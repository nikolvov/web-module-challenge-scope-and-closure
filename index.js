 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example,

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(3) A number of innings
